She added that her husband was protective of the maid but said she could not let their relationship go on. She did not have concrete proof of his infidelity.\n\n“She is stirring trouble at home by causing dispute between my husband and me.. she knows how to play her cards and my mother in law has taken her, my son and my husband into her home”, the woman wrote.\nShe added that she had been providing for the family as her husband was not working, but since they moved into her mother-in-law’s house, he started working to support the maid and pay for their son’s expenses.\nA maid in a relationship with a local guy and then unceremoniously dumped him wrote that hers was “Not your Cinderella kind of story”. the maid wrote that she had been working in Singapore for about a decade. She was an unwed single mother with a teenage son.\n\n“In my first five years here working I’ve met a local Singaporean guy and we became a couple for a year. It ended so quick because I found out that he’ll marry the one that his parents want him to spend with for the rest of his life. Yes, it’s an arranged marriage. Why? Because I am a maid and she works and earns more than my ex, i am a single mom and she’s single without baggage, i am financially unstable and she came from a well off family both here in Singapore and her home country”, she wrote.",

        "content": "Maid spikes baby’s milk with Panadol in CCTV footage; parents trusted her because of her good job performance & attitude\n\nParents of a newborn son were shocked to see through CCTV footage that their domestic helper was abusing their child.\nThe family also discovered hundreds of pills in their helper’s drawer, which the latter used to spike the three-month-old baby’s milk on multiple occasions.\nMr Lin hired the 27-year-old helper from Myanmar in Aug 2021.\nShe initially performed well at her job and had a good attitude.\nHowever, Mr Lin saw through CCTV footage\nAlthough they didn’t punish the woman for what happened, the employers reminded her of her responsibility to care for the infant.\nTwo months later, they witnessed the helper dragging the child by the arm across his crib.\nThe couple went through the CCTV footage once more this year after noticing their son stopped gaining weight.\n\nThey saw the helper opening a cabinet to retrieve a pill during their son’s feeding time.\nThe woman walked towards a blind spot of the camera before presumably spiking the milk with the pill and shaking the bottle.\n“The blood test report came out fine, but he was much thinner than other children of the same age, and I was worried that his development would be affected,” said Mr Lin.\nThe parents informed the police when the incident happened on May 12.\nUpon investigation, the helper admitted to putting Panadol in the milk, noting this was not the first time she had done so.\nShe also claimed to put an appetite-boosting pill from her country into the drink.\nIt was reported that Mrs Lin discovered hundreds of pills in the helper’s drawer, some dating as far back as August last year.\nThey initially assumed the Panadol and flu & cough medicine were for the woman when she felt unwell.\n\nThey never thought the pills would be used to spike their son’s milk.\nThe family has since hired a new helper, whom they will monitor more closely.\nThe case is currently under police investigation.\nResponding to the incident, parents admitted they never felt comfortable leaving their young children with a domestic helper.\n“I never trusted a maid to take care of my kids when they were small,” said Facebook user William Lim, followed by another parent who said the incident “was a reason why he didn’t want to have any maid looking after his kids.”\n\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Family Privacy Compromised",
        "content": "A foreign domestic helper took to social media justifying that as long as she did not reveal her employer’s address or personal details in the photos or videos she took, she should be allowed to post the images.\nOne employer took to a social media group asking domestic helpers for their thoughts on taking videos in their employer’s house and posting them online. The woman “Dear Helpers, I’d like to seek your point of view. I’ve noticed on other pages conflicts between helpers and employers about taking videos to post on social media”.\nShe added that the videos were taken in the employer’s house without permission. She then asked helpers in the group: “For those who do take videos in the employer’s residence to post on social media, what’s your thoughts on this? I’d like to seek views from everyone who both does this and doesn't this, just to understand everyone’s thoughts and position on this topic”.\nOne helper: “For example I’m in my room at night, after work, I take photos of myself, of course, behind me is my employer’s wall. Am I compromising their privacy and safety by doing so? If the employer is so strict about their doors or walls or ceiling popping up as the background of my selfie after work, I don’t think I can work from them. What is scary is when we take photos and videos outside the employer’s house showing the blk, house number, or in the hallway showing a clear description of their location.. I know my boundaries, I know what to post and what not to”.\n\nMost others said that the matter should be discussed beforehand with the employers. Another helper said: “Employers should inform the helper first and foremost about their rules of not putting their family especially kids on social media.. because some employers were okay, some are not .. and for the helpers like me , if they forgot to inform us ,we need to ask our employers if they’re okay posting them .. Everybody needs their privacy right.. so we need to respect each other. No hate. Just love”.\nAccording to the Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act, the following example was given: “Photo-taking by an individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity Diana, an employee of Organisation XYZ, attends XYZ’s corporate social responsibility event. At the event, she meets her friend Dawn. During a break in the programme, they have a personal chat and catch up on each other’s personal lives. During the chat, Diana takes a photograph of the two of them to update her friends of the encounter via social media. Diana then uploads the photograph and displays it on her personal social media page. In this instance, Diana would likely be considered to be an individual acting in a personal or domestic capacity, and would not be required to comply with the Data Protection Provisions in respect of the photo-taking and subsequent disclosure of the photograph via her social media account.\nNotwithstanding the above, the Data Protection Provisions may apply in other contexts where Diana is not acting in a personal or domestic capacity. For example, if the photograph is subsequently published for XYZ’s publicity purposes (such as in XYZ’s corporate brochures or website) instead of for Diana’s personal purposes, the Data Protection Provisions are likely to apply to XYZ in respect of the collection, use and disclosure of the photograph. For example, XYZ will have to obtain Dawn’s consent before publishing her photograph for XYZ’s business purpose”.\nEarlier this year, a frustrated employer of a foreign domestic helper complained on social media that her maid would not only “scold her vulgarities” on TikTok videos but also “wear makeup at home, wear s*xy underwear, tiktok around the house and then she told us she cannot finish her duties because she has too many things to do”.\nThe woman, also her neighbor’s maid, also said that her helper “has a Facebook with a lot of guys chatting. Her private life yes but she is also married with kids back in the Philippines”. The employer wrote that she had spoken to her maid over five times asking her not to film TikToks in the house, or even in her room as they were a private family. “It is ok for her to have a TikTok account and dance outside or with her friends. I don’t think I should control her use of TikTok outside. It’s none of my business. Just don’t do it in my house because we have pictures of the kids (we also don’t like guests)”, the woman wrote.\n\n\nMaid says she is not interested in working as a domestic helper any more\n\nSuggested post: “Can I check if the helper is not interested in working as a domestic helper anymore, Is she able to change jobs instead?”\n\nTo this, the helper would have to return to her home country after canceling her Work Permit (WP) and then re-apply to come to Singapore for skilled work.\nanswered: “Nope.. as far as MOM rules work permit is not allow (sic) to change skilled work… You must go back to your country and apply for skilled work otherwise you’ll stick with a work permit… Job here they prioritize PR/locals only not unless there is a sponsor but still you must apply in your own country”.\nSuggested: “It’s not easy but it’s possible. 1:20,000 ratio, perhaps. Each of us dream for a better paying job, who doesn’t? But before you dream high, ask yourself, are you qualified? To switch from domestic to non domestic sector, you must have the certificate/diploma and relevant experience”.\nEarlier this year, another employer asked if the insurance she bought for her current helper would be transferable to a new maid.\nIn an anonymous post to a support group for domestic helpers and employers alike, the employer wrote that her maid was a direct hire without an agency. She added that within a month of her maid’s arrival, it became clear that her maid was not keen on “doing helper duties but seriously trying to source for upskilling and join a different industry in Singapore. Everyone has their rights to chase their dreams and live a qualitative and happy life. but to do so at the expense of another is disappointing”.\nThe woman asked others for advice on the matter. She also thanked other helpers for “being the helping hand of the families here”.\nSuggested it was unfair of the helper to behave as such. One said: “That’s unfair. It's not good to take advantage of other people to chase your dream.. U can finish the contract then change job if u want.. Tell your helper if you blacklisted him/her, then working in Singapore will not be allowed by MOM.”\n\n",
